HaxePunk demo 06
================

This demo showcases:
--------------------

This demo builds on the shoot-em-up example from demo 05, but adds:

* A scrolling background from a map file made with [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) (uses [https://lib.haxe.org/p/HaxePunkTmx/](HaxePunkTmx))
* Starting the player off based on an [object](http://docs.mapeditor.org/en/stable/manual/objects/) in the Tiled map
* Load sprite sheets from one image using `haxepunk.graphics.Spritemap`
* Sprite animations using the Spritemap's `.play()` method
* Sound effects using the `haxepunk.Sfx` API
* Centering the camera on the player sprite
