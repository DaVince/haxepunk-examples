Haxepunk example demos
======================

I made these demo games for myself in order to learn HaxePunk, but I think that
they will very much be useful to other people as well, hence this upload.

It is likely that in the future, I will add more demos tackling different things.

Table of contents
-----------------

* [Demo 01](demo01) - Scene & entity creation and destruction
* [Demo 02](demo02) - Keyboard input, sounds, collision, entities and their types
* [Demo 03](demo03) - 360 degree movement using trigonometry; setting sprite angles
* [Demo 04](demo04) - Nothing of note - sprite bouncing using a sine function
* [Demo 05](demo05) - Small shmup demo with different enemy types and movements
* [Demo 06](demo06) - Shmup demo, extended with sprite maps and Tiled map engine (through HaxePunkTmx)

How do I compile/run these?
---------------------------

1. [Get HaxePunk](https://haxepunk.com/).
1. Run `lime test html5` (or whatever target you like).
1. If you want to debug, run `lime test html5 -debug` instead.

These demos were written by DaVince for HaxePunk 4.x.  
Please let me know if any of the demos break, contain mistakes, or if you have improvements.
